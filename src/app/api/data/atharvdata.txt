• Reduced model evaluation time by automated testing and performance evaluation done by deploying python model evaluation 
scripts in docker containers to AWS Lambda. 
• Computed metrics such as MSE, MAE, R² Score and stored them in DynamoDB. 
• Built an interactive streamlit dashboard to present the metrics over time in an intuitive manner for easy visualization. 

Autonomous Driving Model  
• A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for autonomous driving, inspired by Nvidia's end-to-end learning for self-driving 
cars research paper, tested using the Udacity Driving Simulator.  
• Achieved a 90% success rate in lane keeping and applying data augmentation techniques such as Gaussian Blur to improve 
training results. 
• Attained 98% accuracy on the model after training on 50 epochs using the Google Cloud Platform.   
AI Job Board  
• An AI-driven Job Board leveraging data from US Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide actionable career insights. Integrated a 
salary prediction model with over 85% accuracy using Random Forest Regression and a user-based collaborative filtering 
recommendation system powered by cosine similarity, enhancing suggestions by 30%. 
• Implemented an interactive dashboard with the streamlit and plotly libraries, to visualize key trends such as salary projections, 
high-demand skills, growing and declining industry sectors, and much more, enabling users to make data-informed career 
decisions. 

Clash Royale Analytics Dashboard 
• Built an interactive analytics dashboard using python and the panel library to efficiently process and analyze over 13 GB of 
player data from the popular strategy game Clash Royale. 
• Leveraged algorithms like K-Means Clustering to uncover insights on metrics such as elixir usage, card usage and other 
gameplay trends across 20+ arenas, assisting strategic decision making for players.
