WORK EXPERIENCE 
Machine Learning Research Assistant, Rutgers University, Camden, NJ                      
December 2024 – Present 
• Implemented a Multiple Convolution Network (MulCNN) for classification of Heat Shock Proteins into distinct protein families, achieving a 
94% accuracy. 
• Processed and transformed 12,000+ records from FASTA files into pandas dataframes, optimizing data preprocessing for seamless model 
training. 
• Developed a web-based tool integrating the machine learning model, resulting in real-time classification capabilities for users. 
Software Developer Intern, Independence Education, Philadelphia, PA                                                                                                  
June 2024 – August 2021 
• Designed a chatbot prototype using the GPT-3.5-turbo model and langchain, integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 
architecture for enhanced accuracy and contextual relevance, which increased user interaction and support efficiency. 
• Built a data analytics dashboard that links to the Canvas student software, leveraging technologies such as TypeScript, React.js, Chart.js, 
PostgreSQL, and Node.js to provide actionable insights, enhancing user engagement and data-driven decision making. 
• Boosted application performance by implementing optimized code practices and modern development tools, achieving a 30% increase in 
internal efficiency and development speed during peak feature development sprints. 


PROJECTS 
Driver Drowsiness Detection System and Retraining Pipeline 
• Achieved 90% detection accuracy by fine-tuning a YOLOv8 model for real-time drowsiness detection, processing real-time frames using 
Kafka and Spark Streaming, ensuring immediate alerts and WhatsApp notifications to registered phone numbers. 
• Reduced false positive rate by 40% through an automated retraining pipeline, where misclassified images are reported via an AWS Lambda 
function, stored in S3, and used for model fine-tuning with Apache Airflow. 
• Improved model monitoring and experimentation efficiency by integrating MLflow for tracking model versions, hyperparameters, and 
performance metrics, ensuring continuous optimization. 
Modalytics: Machine Learning Model Evaluation Platform 
• Created an automated ML Model Evaluation Pipeline integrating AWS Lambda, S3, DynamoDB. 
• Reduced model evaluation time by automated testing and performance evaluation by deploying python evaluation scripts to AWS Lambda 
via Docker containers and saving evaluation metrics to DynamoDB. 
• Built an interactive streamlit and plotly dashboard to present the metrics over time in an intuitive manner for easy visualization. 
Wine Quality Prediction ETL Pipeline 
• Engineered an end-to-end ETL machine learning pipeline for wine quality prediction by developing components for data ingestion, 
validation transformation and training an ElasticNet Regression model for improved prediction accuracy.  
• Orchestrated MLFlow for experiment tracking and logging, and capturing key metrics such as MSE, R2 score, and accuracy.  
• Deployed a Flask web application for real-time model inference, enabling users to input wine properties and obtain instant predictions. 
AI Job Board  
• An AI-driven Job Board leveraging data from US Bureau of Labor Statistics to provide actionable career insights such as skill gap between 
required skills and the user’s skills, susceptibility towards being replaced by AI, market demand, etc. Integrated a salary prediction model 
with over 85% accuracy using Random Forest Regression and a user-based collaborative filtering recommendation system powered by 
cosine similarity, enhancing suggestions by 30%. 
• Generated an interactive dashboard with the streamlit and plotly libraries, to visualize key trends such as salary projections, high-demand 
skills, growing and declining industry sectors, and much more, enabling users to make data-informed career decisions.
