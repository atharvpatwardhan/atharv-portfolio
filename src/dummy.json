    "description": "I'm a software engineer based in New Jersey, USA. I love to learn new technologies and build meaningful things with them. I have a keen interest in Mathematics and am enthusiastic about building machine learning and deep learning solutions to solve real-world problems. I'm currently pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics from Rutgers University. If you're looking for someone with a passion for technology, collaborative spirit and a great sense of humour, I'm your guy! When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing Badminton, Chess and also have a liking for painting and music. Feel free to reach out to me if you have a cool project idea, or just want to chat!",
